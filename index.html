                <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Yoga and doing various stretches can make you more flexible.</li>

            <p>They found that, mile for mile, brisk walking lowers the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure as much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running" target="_blank">Running</a> does. The difference? You'll have to spend more time walking than you do running to get the same health benefits simply because it takes longer to walk than to run the same distance.<br>
                The benefits of physical activity and exercise have been recognized for as long as man has been around. Our first ancestors didn't think they were exercising. For them, it was more like chasing their next meal to survive instead of chasing a ball to win a game or going for a leisurely stroll. Regardless, in order to survive, they had to be actively engaged in moderate levels of physical activity either through hunting or gathering foods for their sustenance. In other words: no exercise, no food; no food, death.</p>
